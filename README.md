# Vigenere-Cipher-Cracker
A series of scripts relating to Vigenere Cipher to help you encrypt, decrypt, as well as cracking unknown keys using frequency analysis and index of coincidence analysis.

## Instructions
Run the script accordingly to what you want to accomplish: 
- Encrypt plaintext using a key: ```python3 encrypt.py```
- Decrypt ciphertext using a key: ```python3 decrypt.py```
- Crack the ciphertext with known key length: ```python3 crack_with_keylength.py```
- Crack the ciphertext not knowing anything about the key: ```python3 crack.py```
